# Snapshot Photo Search
Snapshot is a full stack project that pulls data from the Unsplash API and displays a grid of photos based upon the user's search criteria. Additionally, users can click on any photo and view a full-size version of the photo, as well as have the option to download it. A save search function makes it easy for users to save and revisit past searches, and these searches can also be removed.
